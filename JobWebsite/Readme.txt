TODO:

Add functionality for a user to apply for a job
    - Needs thinking about...thinking of re-doing Attachment.model to take a list of attachments, so can add multiple files, and mark as default etc.

Add area for users to see who's applied for a job they have posted
Add search for user list
Add postcode lookup - postcodes.io

Need a way to apply for emails - send email to job email address?
