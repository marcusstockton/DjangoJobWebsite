Notes for me:
have Jobs working in so far as index, details and edit pages go.

In company views, the edit page now adds in widgets, but I need to wire up Instance so it loads data to the form.
Also need to actually save the data.

TODO:
Create a string list of years for the User Edit form.
Fix up the format the date is passed in for date of birth in User edit form


Create a way to add new JObs / Companies etc
Change the Nav to show the user name once logged in
